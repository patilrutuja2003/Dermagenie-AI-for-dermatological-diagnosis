DermaGenie: Generative AI for Dermatological diagnosis

Introduction:
DermaGenie is an advanced AI-driven system designed to assist in the diagnosis of skin diseases by leveraging a combination of deep learning techniques, including Generative AI. The project addresses the challenges of manual diagnosis, such as subjectivity and inconsistencies, which can lead to misclassifications and delayed treatments. This system aims to improve diagnostic accuracy, reduce the clinical workload, and enhance patient care through its comprehensive features.

Features:
Disease Classification: The core of the system is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on the HAM10000 dataset to classify various skin diseases with high accuracy.
Generative AI for Interpretability: The project incorporates Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to produce counterfactual images, which are synthetic variations that simulate how different diseases might appear. This helps clinicians and patients differentiate between visually similar conditions and enhances the system's transparency and trustworthiness.
Personalized Treatment Recommendations: The system uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module to generate comprehensive prescription reports. It retrieves up-to-date medical information and dynamically combines it with the model's predictions to provide tailored recommendations, including medications and dietary advice.
Prediction Verification with Large Language Models (LLMs): To ensure reliability, an LLM (such as GPT-4, Gemini, or LLaMA) is integrated to verify and justify the CNN's predictions by cross-referencing them with medical knowledge. This adds a layer of transparency and interpretability to the diagnosis.
User-Friendly Interface: The system is deployed as an interactive web application using the Streamlit framework, allowing users to easily upload images, view predictions, and access personalized recommendations.
Severity Staging: The system can also evaluate the severity of the disease by categorizing it into four distinct stages, providing nuanced insights for treatment planning.
